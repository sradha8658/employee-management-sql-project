  -- Situational Questions on Table Schema Modifications (with Retrieval for Data Consistency) ----

  
  -- Situation -1: Due to a change in company policy, we need to rename the Employee table to Staff. 
-- Please perform the necessary operation to rename the table. 
-- Note: Please do retrieve the changes made for consistency of the data. If you are changing the

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD DateOfBirth DATE;

INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, Salary, DateOfJoining, Email, DateOfBirth)
VALUES ('Ananya', 'Sharma', 1, 48000, '2024-01-10', 'ananya.sharma@example.com', '1995-07-21');

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth
FROM Employees
LIMIT 10;

-- Situation -4: We need to change the data type of the Salary column in the Employee table from INT 
-- to DECIMAL(10,2) to accommodate fractional salary amounts. 
-- Note: Please do retrieve the changes made for consistency of the data, ensuring that all existing 
-- salary data is preserved accurately.

ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY Salary DECIMAL(10,2);

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 57500.75
WHERE EmployeeID = 120;


-- Situation -5: To better categorize employees, we need to add a new column EmployeeCategory in 
-- the Employee table. The column should accept values like "Full-time", "Part-time", or "Contract". 
-- Note: Please ensure the changes are reflected and retrieve the updated schema for consistency. 
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD EmployeeCategory VARCHAR(20);
INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID, Salary, DateOfJoining, Email, EmployeeCategory)

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_employee_category
CHECK (EmployeeCategory IN ('Full-time', 'Part-time', 'Contract'));

-- Situation -6: The company wants to keep track of the department name for employees. 
-- Therefore, a column DepartmentName should be added to the Employee table. 
-- Note: After making the change, please retrieve the updates to ensure the column is populated 
-- correctly for future entries.
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD DepartmentName VARCHAR(100);

UPDATE Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
SET e.DepartmentName = d.DepartmentName;

-- Situation -7: We need to set the default value of the Status column in the Employee table to 
-- "Active" for any new employee added to the database. 
-- Note: After applying this change, please retrieve the changes and verify that all new employee 
-- records default to "Active".

-- Situation -8: As part of a company-wide restructuring, the DepartmentID column in the Employee 
-- table should be renamed to TeamID to reflect the new team-based structure. 
-- Note: Please retrieve the changes made for consistency of the data. If necessary, restore the 
-- column name back to DepartmentID for future references. 

ALTER TABLE Employees
CHANGE COLUMN DepartmentID TeamID INT;
DESCRIBE Employees;

ALTER TABLE Employees
CHANGE COLUMN TeamID DepartmentID INT;


-- Situation -9: The company has decided to archive old employee data, so the Employee table needs 
-- to be partitioned by JoinDate in order to keep the data for employees who joined before 2020 
-- separate. 
-- Note: After partitioning the data, ensure to retrieve the changes and check the data consistency 
-- and accessibility for employees prior to 2020.
SHOW CREATE TABLE Employees;

ALTER TABLE Employees

-- Situation -10: We need to create a foreign key constraint between the Employee table and the 
-- Department table to ensure the integrity of the department data linked to each employee. 
-- Note: Please retrieve the changes made to verify the foreign key relationship, ensuring data 
-- integrity and consistency across both tables.
